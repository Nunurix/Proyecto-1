<h1>Longevity and nutrition: The case of Spain, Japan and the United States.</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This project is part of the Ironhack boothcamp <a href=https://www.ironhack.com/> https://www.ironhack.com/ </a>. We want to explain the relationship between food supply, life expectancy and obesity. </p>
<p>In this repository, you will find, in total, four documents:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Python code</li>
        <li>Functions used</li>
        <li>PDF presentation</li>
        <li>This document</li>
    </ul></p>
<h2>Starting questions</h2>
<p>
        The questions we want to address in this study are the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Is there a direct relationship between longevity and nutrition?</li>
        <li>Does this relationship also exist in our country with a Mediterranean diet?</li>
        <li>In the case of Japan, whose diet is also known to be nutritious?</li>
        <li>And in the USA, whose diet is known to be very high in fat?</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<h2>Origin of the data</h2> 
    <p>
        The information we have worked with comes from two sources:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            On the one hand, we have looked at <a href="https://datosmacro.expansion.com/demografia/esperanza-vida/" target="_blank">La Expansi√≥n</a> on global life expectancy.
        </li>
        <li>
            We have also used data from the <a href="https://www.fao.org/faostat/es/#data/FBS" target="_blank">FAO (Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations)</a>.
        </li>
    </ul>
